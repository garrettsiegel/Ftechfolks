                <h3>Growth is enhanced by working collaboratively</h3>
                <p>To become successful in a competitive landscape is incredibly challenging and founders are frequently expected to be experts in all business, technical and market areas.</p>
                <p>Part of the journey for start-ups and Fintechs is learning how to avoid mistakes and maximise efficiency by surrounding yourself with the right strategic advisors and support networks.</p>
                <p>Finding the right people that fit in with your organisational culture and the specific challenges you face is difficult. Ftechfolk have built an exclusive fintech advisory network to help you connect with strategic advisors that can guide and assist you and your business.
                <br> These folk have extensive and successful previous experience. They have completed Fintech projects from ‘idea’ stage to completion and as such are ideally qualified to help with the steep learning curve of being a first-time, venture-backed CEO or offer advice to more established companies.</p>
                <p>It is essential to find people that are truly committed to helping you, as without the input from these professionals many mistakes are made that could have been prevented.</p>
                <p>Ftechfolk understand that each business will have its own specific demands and has established a flexible network of friendly and highly capable advisors to call upon that can accommodate all of your needs.</p>
                <h2 id="advisory-h2-2">Getting to know you</h2>
                <p class="advisory-highlight">It is critical that we get to know you and your business to ensure you get the most out of our network. By understanding your company, we are able to connect you with the right people that will enable you to unlock growth and scale. <br><br> 
                Our Advisors have demonstrable expertise and understanding of the Fintech industry, and the journey that Founders undertake when scaling a business. We carefully bring together those who will bring value to the specific businesses in our network and provide the essential framework to achieve success.
